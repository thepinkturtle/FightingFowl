This web app allows one to upload two specific json files and compare them.

## Design Decisions
Django was choosen as a framework for this app because it's great at handling json data and it is easy 
to deploy on multiple plateforms. Also, I wanted to challenge myself and relearn a new framework I haven't 
worked with in years.

## Assumptions
It is assumed that the two files will have the same json scheme as the test files given in the problem statement
and they will be named ``orders.json`` and ``restocks.json``

## Instructions for running the app
#### Must have:
 - Django 1.8 or later
 - Python 2.7 or later

#### Installation
  - ``git clone ``
